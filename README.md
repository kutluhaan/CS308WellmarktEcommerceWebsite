🛒 Wellmarkt: Your Modern E-commerce Website
📝 What's This All About?
Welcome to the Wellmarkt project! This is a modern e-commerce platform built to provide a great shopping experience. It's a full-stack application with both a frontend and a backend, designed to handle everything from user authentication and product listings to shopping carts and order processing. The goal was to create a clean, functional, and responsive site that's easy for shoppers to use.

🚀 Key Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login.

Product Management: A complete system for adding, updating, and viewing products.

Shopping Cart: A smooth and intuitive shopping cart experience.

Order Processing: A streamlined checkout process for placing orders.

Responsive Design: Looks great and works perfectly on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.

⚙️ What's Under the Hood?
This project is a full-stack application, which means it has two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

Frontend:

React: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.

CSS: For all the styling and visual design.

Backend:

Spring Boot: A powerful Java framework for the backend server.

Java: The core programming language for the server-side logic.

Maven: For managing project dependencies and builds.

MySQL: A robust relational database for storing all the data.
