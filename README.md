üõí Wellmarkt, Your Modern E-commerce Website
üìù What is This All About?
Welcome to the Wellmarkt project! This is a modern e-commerce platform built to provide a great shopping experience. It's a full-stack application with both a frontend and a backend, designed to handle everything from user authentication and product listings to shopping carts and order processing. The goal was to create a clean, functional, and responsive site that's easy for shoppers to use.

üöÄ Key Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login.

Product Management: A complete system for adding, updating, and viewing products.

Shopping Cart: A smooth and intuitive shopping cart experience.

Order Processing: A streamlined checkout process for placing orders.

Responsive Design: Looks great and works perfectly on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.

‚öôÔ∏è What's Under the Hood?
This project is a full-stack application, which means it has two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

Frontend:

React: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.

CSS: For all the styling and visual design.

Backend:

Spring Boot: A powerful Java framework for the backend server.

Java: The core programming language for the server-side logic.

Maven: For managing project dependencies and builds.

MySQL: A robust relational database for storing all the data.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Get Started
Since this is a full-stack project, you'll need to set up both the backend and the frontend.

Backend Setup
Open in IDE: Open the cs308-backend folder in your favorite Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

Configure Database: Make sure your MySQL database is running and update the src/main/resources/application.properties file with your database credentials.

Run the Server: Start the Spring Boot application.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to Frontend: Open a new terminal and go into the frontend directory:

cd cs308-frontend/wellmarkt
